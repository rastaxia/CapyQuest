              </span>
              <span>
                Amanda: He also used to be my best friend. You see when you go
                to a magic school, young witches and wizards get assigned a
                warrior to protect them
              </span>
              <span>
                Amanda: Because most of us are not strong enough to protect our
                selves yet... Even after graduating most witches just become
                healers
              </span>
              <span>
                Amanda: Zyklon was my warrior, he was the best warrior in the
                school, he was so strong and kind and he always protected me...
                I wasn't the best of students. I gave him a lot of trouble but
                even when I swore at him he would just smile
              </span>

            <span> As you walk you see a big castle in the distance </span>
            <span class="you">
              you start to feel uneasy and your hairs are starting to stand up
            </span>
            <span>
              Amanda: That must be the castle, I can feel the magic coming from
              there
            </span>
            <span>
              Amanda: I'm not sure if you're ready for this but we have to go in
            </span>

            <p>
              <span>
                As the two of you walk up to the castle you see a big gate
              </span>
              <span>
                Amanda: I'll try to open it you just stay behind me okay?
              </span>
              <span class="you">
                You nod your head and stay behind Amanda
              </span>
              <span>
                Amanda's staff starts to glow and she points it at the gate
              </span>
              <span>
                After a second a big hole is blown in the gate the gate just
                stats to open
              </span>
              <span>
                Amanda: Oh.... it was open.... I guess I didn't have to do that
              </span>
              <span>
                Amanda: Well let's go in, I can feel the magic coming from
                inside
              </span>
              <span>
                As you walk in you see a man standing in the middle of the room
              </span>
              <span>
                Amanda: Zyklon! It's been so long! How have you been?
              </span>
              <span>
                Zyklon looks at Amanda and you can see his eyes are glowing red,
                he doesn't answer
              </span>
              <span> PREPARE FOR COMBAT </span>

              nothing</span
            >
            <span>
              No sound no movement, he just stands there with his eyes glowing
            </span>
            <span>
              Amanda just sighs and looks at you, she looks sad and defeated
            </span>
            <span> Amanda: I'm sorry buddy I hope you're okay </span>
            <span>
              Amanda walks towards the still standing Zyklon and touches his
              face
            </span>
            <span>
              When she does this his eyes stop glowing and he disappears into
              dust
            </span>
            <span>
              She picks up the crystal eyes not full of joy... not full of
              sadness... just nothing
            </span>
            <span> She sighs </span>
            <span>
              Amanda: Hey buddy, this is it this is the source.... but I don't
              think we should use it
            </span>
            <span> Amanda: I am sorry for wasting your time </span>
            <span> She opens a portal and walks through it </span>
            <span>
              You are alone just you after all this time it's still you
            </span>
